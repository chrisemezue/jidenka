# Jidenka
“Jide Nka” is an Igbo word which means “always be creative” or “always hold on to creativity.” This name is specially chosen to represent the constant creative state of the proposed AI platform and its ability to collaborate with its human agent in the creative process as it affects the different genres of African Literature. 

The objective behind this effort is to use Artificial Intelligence in creating a poem, which will not only carry the African experience and worldview, but will reveal and share Africa’s poetic sensibilities and styles.


## Initial attempt - The African Robo Poems 

The two poems “Pause and Wander” and “The African Poetry is” herein called African Robo Poems  were composed by G.M.T Emezue using the Google AI platform [Verse by Verse](https://sites.research.google/versebyverse/). 

The process of producing an African poem via Google’s Verse by Verse AI platform was a very interesting and memorable experience. The instructions on how to select “muses,” (who were prominent American poets from different generations) were quite easy and simple t o follow. And at the input of the first line of poem, these “muses” will provide line suggestions, from which one is required to make a choice. 

Interestingly, since my objective was to write a poem, which while being universal, still reflected African worldview and sensibilities, I was initially startled when I encountered linguistic images that were alienated from the African environment and cultural norms. This is not surprising since a poet’s style is determined in part by the images associated with his/her poetic diction. Thus, since the muses were all non-African poets, it is not surprising that the poetic styles, images and sensibilities, which I encountered in Google’s Verse by Verse reflected western environment, cultural norms and experiences.  

After some effort, I was able to produce the poems “***Pause and Wander***” and “***African poetry is***” from the Google’s Verse by Verse AI platform.

Furthermore, although the two poems have very interesting poetic qualities, yet they cannot be called African poems, because of ***their inability to effectively reflect African images, sensibilities and world views***. These, among other issues inspired the duo [G.M.T Emezue](https://www.gmtemezue.com/) (a creative writer and critic) and [Chris Emezue](https://mila.quebec/en/person/chris-emezue/) to collaborate towards creating an AI platform called “JideNka” which will enable creative writers to create African Prose, Poem or drama. This is a work in progress.
